# Circle Properties Calculator and Plotter

This Python project calculates the properties of circles (area and circumference) for a given set of radii and visualizes the relationship between the radius and area using the third-party library `matplotlib`.

## Features
- **Circle Class**: Represents a circle, with methods to calculate the area and circumference.
- **Filter Positive Numbers**: A utility function to filter positive numbers from a list.
- **Calculate Circle Properties**: A function to compute the area and circumference for a list of circle radii.
- **Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` to plot a graph of circle areas against the radii.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **matplotlib**: A third-party library for plotting graphs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/circle-properties-calculator.git
   cd circle-properties-calculator
